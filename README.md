### <div id="fonts">Fonts</div>

The fonts chosen were Roboto for the body, RobotoCondensed for the headings and Satisfy for the logo. Sans Serif was chosen as the backup font. 

### <div id="colours">Colours</div>

The colour theme is based around the orange colour `#db430c` which harmonizes with the coat colour of poodles. These colours are used for the headings and logo. To create the colour pallete I used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel). Brown `#2b1800` was chosen for the font colour as it is less harsh to the users' eyes than black.
