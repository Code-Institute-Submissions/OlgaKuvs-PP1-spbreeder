                        Poodles are excellent with kids, and they get along with kids of all ages. When it comes to younger kids, they are sturdy, with slightly older kids they are playful and intelligent, and with teenagers, they are energetic enough to go out for swimming or a brisk walk.

                        <hr>
                        The Poodle is considered to be a hypoallergenic dog, which means that people who are allergic to dogs can still own one without triggering an allergic reaction. This is because poodles shed very little and do not produce a lot of dander, which is the primary cause of dog allergies.

                        Poodles are known to be highly affected by the mood of their owners and of their atmosphere around them. They can quickly shift from the happiest dog in the world, to being apprehensive or sad because their owner comes home after a bad day and they and sense sadness.

                            <hr>
                            Poodles are recommended for people who prefer dogs that naturally have low odor. Poodles are generally not smelly dogs, they don't have that “doggy smell” like other breeds.

                            <hr>
                            Poodles don't shed much, but they are not completely “non-shedding,” either. All dogs with hair shed (or molt) to some extent. It's just that Poodles shed a lot less, and given the texture of their coat, most of the hair they do molt gets trapped within their coat.

                            <hr>
                            Poodle is actually a very clever and active, hard working dog. Poodle training is something that both the dog and owner can really enjoy and benefit from. They also learn very quickly and can be taught numerous tricks and take part in a wide range of canine hobbies.
